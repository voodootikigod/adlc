# /adlc-ticket — author a ticket (P0 Triage)

Tickets are the contract every downstream ADLC tool reads (`coldstart`,
`model-router`, `merge-forecast`, `rails-guard`). This command turns a request
into a well-formed, self-contained ticket appended to `.adlc/tickets.json`.

The request to triage: **$ARGUMENTS** (if empty, ask the user what the ticket is
for).

## 0. Preconditions

- Ensure `.adlc/tickets.json` exists. If it does not, tell the user to run
  `/adlc-init` first (do not silently create the workspace here).
- Read the current `.adlc/tickets.json` so you know the existing ticket ids and
  can pick the next unused one.

## 1. Shape the ticket

A ticket must be **executable without guesswork** (that is exactly what
`coldstart` will check). Gather or infer:

- **id** — the next free `T<n>` (T1, T2, …); must be unique in the file.
- **title** — one line, imperative.
- **body** — full, self-contained ticket text: what to build, the acceptance
  criteria with concrete verification methods, and any context an agent needs.
  Do not assume the agent can see this conversation.
- **scope** — array of file globs this ticket may touch (e.g. `["src/auth/**"]`).
- **rails** — array of frozen paths that must NOT change during the build (e.g.
  `["test/auth/**"]`). Declaring rails here is what later lets the rail-guard
  gate block edits to them. Default to `[]` if none.
- **edges** — dependencies on other tickets, each `{ "to": "T2", "contract":
  "src/types/auth.d.ts" }`. Default `[]`.
- **duration** — relative build-time estimate, positive number (default `1`).
- **category** — free-form routing hint (e.g. `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`).
- **budget** — optional token budget (omit if unknown).

If anything required for a *self-contained* ticket is ambiguous, ask the user
rather than guessing — a vague ticket fails `coldstart`.

## 2. Append immutably and validate

- Build the new ticket object. Validate it against the schema before writing:
  `id` and `title` are required strings; `scope`, `rails`, `edges` are arrays;
  `duration` is a positive number; every `edge.to` must reference an existing
  ticket id.
- Append it to the `tickets` array — read, copy, add, write the whole file back.
  Never mutate or reorder existing entries. Preserve 2-space JSON formatting.

## 3. Check executability (coldstart gate)

`coldstart` is LLM-backed, and inside Claude Code **you are the model** — there
are no API keys. Do NOT run the bare `adlc coldstart <id>` form; with no provider
configured it exits `1`. Use the prompt-only flow instead:

1. Run `adlc coldstart <id> --prompt-only`. This prints the executability-audit
   prompt (the ticket plus instructions to find gaps that would force an agent to
   ask a human) and exits `0` without calling any provider.
2. **Answer that prompt yourself**, applying its own rubric: list every genuine
   gap that would block a fresh agent (information not derivable from the repo).
3. Report the verdict:
   - No gaps → the ticket is executable; done.
   - Gaps found → summarize them and offer to revise the ticket body/scope to
     close them, then re-run the prompt-only check.

(If the user has explicitly configured an API key and prefers a real provider
call, `adlc coldstart <id> --json` returns the same verdict as exit `0`/`2`; but
prompt-only is the default in-Claude path.)

## 4. Summarize

Report the new ticket id and title, what scope/rails it declared, and the
coldstart verdict. If the ticket passed, point the user at the `adlc` discovery
skill (or `/adlc-spec`-style spec gates) for the P1 interrogation phase next.
